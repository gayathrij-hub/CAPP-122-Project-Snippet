Code snippet of my work done over the coursework project

Me and my amazing teammates worked on an incredible project over the winter quarter (2024) as part of our course "Computer Science with Applications". The project sought to explore the multifaceted impacts of climate change and its distributional effects on communities across the United States. â€¯The aim was to understand how climate-induced factors such as floods, heatwaves, and hurricanes disproportionately affect vulnerable populations particularly in redlined communities. Leveraging data from the EPA, FEMA, Richmond Redlining dataset, Census, and a chatbot was created for a user to know about the climate induced vulnerability within th ecommunities of 5 states in the US namely (New Orleans, Illinois, California, Texas, Lousiana), we aimed to provide a tool to explore the ways climate change will affect communities differently and how those impacts may (or may not) disproportionately affect marginalized groups.

I worked on pulling 3 datasets from the Census.gov website for understanding the demographic information of the people residing in these 5 states. As the Chatbot used the format of converting user inputs (or questions) to SQL queries to pull up information from the data that was collected by my team. I worked on creating a SQL database that dynamically traverses through the sub-folder where the members pushed there dataset output in CSV format to add them as tables in the "Climate Database".
